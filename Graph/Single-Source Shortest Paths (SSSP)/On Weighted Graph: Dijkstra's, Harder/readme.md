Do complete search!! If you terminate early, disastrous!!

Ex: 2, 3, 6

The tree will have multiple (0, 0, 6) tuples. Let's say if we see the first occurrence
of (0, 0, 6) and then I disregard all of the latter ones. What if (0, 0, 6) = 5, 4, 3
in level 1, and then under certain circumstances, (0, 0, 6) = 2 in level 2?

This is why I got WA~~
