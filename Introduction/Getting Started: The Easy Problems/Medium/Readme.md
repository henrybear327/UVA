# Notes

## Read All Problem Statements Carefully!! From input to output!!

## Test cases must include corner cases, such as upper/lower input bounds

### 119

String processing. Need a lot of pre-req.

### 573

A pretty good one. Need to calculate the answer carefully.

### 10324

Divide the string into groups using one linear scan

### 10141

All conditions must be considered carefully

### 10424

When using macro, the parenthesis must always be added!

`#define MAX(x,y) ((x) > (y) ? (x) : (y))`

### 10919

Be aware of the condition commented with `come on, man!`

### 11507

`const char *array[...] = {"", "", ...};`

### 11586

Be aware of tricky corner case, where only one piece is there!

### 11683 (Good one!)

If you need a huge array, such as ``` bool array[10001][10001]```, declare it before main(). (The memory -> stack can't hold array size of 10^7+)

### 11687

Corner case is trivial, but don't forget to ```continue```!!!

### 11956

A classic `printf` problem!
